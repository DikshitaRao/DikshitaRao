- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced hardware verification using SystemVerilog & UVM, and refining my backend skills with Spring Boot & distributed systems.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to software-hardware co-design, machine learning tools, and scalable web applications.
